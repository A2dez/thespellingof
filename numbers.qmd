title: "The spelling of English numbers"
---

The spelling of English numbers is **about as bizarre and inconsistent** as it gets, from the silent letter \<w\> in *two* to the unwritten /w/ at the start of *one*.

Yet three, five, six, nine and ten are all good clean spellings \[\[ who do exactly what they say on the tin, so them // whose \]\] pronunciation is easily predicted from the spelling and the spelling can be predicted from the sound, at least for people who distinguish 'three' and 'tree' differently.

including the invisible 'w' in 'one' and the silent 'w'

Let's leave the madness of one til the end and we'll start with 'two'.

Mark Twain is the pseudonym of American writer and humorist Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910), who had been a riverboat pilot; he took his pen name from the cry mark twain, the call indicating a depth of two fathoms, from mark (n.1) in a specialized sense of "measured notification (a piece of knotted cloth, etc.) on a lead-line indicating fathoms of depth" (1769) + twain.

## Three

improvvisatore

## Five, six, nine, ten 

Five, six, nine and ten are all simple spellings where their sound can be predicted from their spelling and their spelling the sound.

## Seven

The problem with seven is that it looks like it ought to be rhymed with *even*, when in fact it rhymes with *heaven, Kevin* and *eleven*. Most English consonant letters would be doubled here, as in *redden, ledden*, *essence*, but \<v\> never doubled historically as it used to be a vowel letter, so \<vv\> only occurs in a few modern(ish) slang words such as *navvy* and *savvy*, at word boundaries (*revved*, *bevvied*) or loanwords (*improvvisato*).

absence of \<vv\> making it look like it ought to be rhymed with *even*. Most consonant letters would be doubled

This is a quirk of English, so that we have similar
